### SSH and server operations.. --let's go;

In this project, I learned what a server is and how to connect and configure it using SSH. I did some devOps scripting and server operations.

#### This directory contains all task solutions for 0x0B-SSH.

The following general requirements were met:

* All files were interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and end with a new line.

* The first line of all Bash scripts is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

* In the second line of all Bash scripts is a comment explaining what the script does.

* All Bash script files are executable.

* Each folder is for the respective task/projects.

* There were no errors and no warnings during interpretation. All warnings were rectified, and all bugs fixed.
