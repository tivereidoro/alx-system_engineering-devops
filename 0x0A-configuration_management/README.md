### Puppet and config management. --here we go;

In this project, I learned the basic concepts of configuration management. I did some scripting with the basic syntax.

#### This directory contains all task solutions for 0x0A-Configuration management.

The following general requirements were met:

* All files were interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and end with a new line.

* In the first line of all Puppet manifests is a comment explaining what the manifest is about.

* All Puppet manifests pass puppet-lint version 2.1.1 without any errors.

* All Puppet manifests run without errors.

* All Puppet manifests files end with the extension `.pp`

* Each folder is for the respective task/projects.

* There were no errors and no warnings during interpretation. All warnings were rectified, and all bugs fixed.
